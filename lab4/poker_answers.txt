In our git repository we use poker.py and udacity_poker.py. If we compare timer() to udacity_pokers timer we'll get information about how fast the script runs.
The script uses play_poker() as a main gatherer function to print out all hands in play, and then print out the winner hand. The only bug is that if two hands 
are tie, only one of them will be printed at random.
